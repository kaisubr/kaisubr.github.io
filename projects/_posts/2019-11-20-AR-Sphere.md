AR Sphere is a global augmented-reality playground for mobile devices. It allows users to place 3D models and anchor them to real-world coordinates, so that they can be viewed by other users on the platform. 

Placing, collecting, and saving models can occur simultaneously between users, with real-time rendering, due to our tech stack:
* [Unity 3D front-end](https://github.com/EdwardGarmon/ARSphere) (which allows us to export to iOS and Android)
* Built using C# & ASP.NET Core with ability to communicate via SignalR
* [Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/kaisubr/Unity-With-Azure-Blob-Storage)
* [SQL Server; Azure deployment](https://github.com/jackson-nestelroad/ar-sphere-server)
* Azure Spatial Anchors 

The application makes it seamless to integrate with future technologies, such as AR Glasses. 

I worked on this project with a group of 4 other members, as part of the Association for Computing Machinery, Ignite Division. I mainly worked on backend Blob Storage configuration, which required real-time downloading and rendering of 3D models (we worked with `.obj` and `.fbx` models). I also polished interface for the front-end and assisted with server setup.
