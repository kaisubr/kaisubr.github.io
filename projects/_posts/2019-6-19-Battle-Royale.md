Ever wanted to play a battle royale game, but the human players were just too good? Do they always hide and hide before eliminating you?

Try out _Smoke and Dagger_, an isometric-style battle-royale game, with a survival mode as well, that allows you to customize your own games, from the number of bots to play against, to the levels of damage reduction and self-heal you get for eliminating your enemies.

This version is completely offline, so you can play it from the comfort of your home without having to worry about ping issues and try-hard players. Furthermore, it is not graphically intensive at all, although a decent CPU might be preferable.

A JAR file has been provided in the root directory, so it's as easy as downloading it and playing!
