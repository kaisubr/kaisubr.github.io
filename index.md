I'm a [Computing Scholar](http://cs.utdallas.edu/computingscholars/) and [CV honors](https://honors.utdallas.edu/cv) undergraduate CS student at UTD with a strong interest in software engineering, computer vision, and applications of data science. 

Some of my projects that applied these interests, such as an augmented reality platform and an app that used image classification via a CNN, have been awarded in competitions. [View my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kaisubr) or jump to my [projects page](/projects/) to see what I've been working on!
