I'm a [Computing Scholar](http://cs.utdallas.edu/computingscholars/) and [CV honors](https://honors.utdallas.edu/cv) undergraduate CS student at UTD with a strong interest in software engineering, computer vision, and applications of data science. 

Some of my projects that applied these interests have been awarded, such as an augmented reality platform and an app that used image classification via a CNN. [Jump to my projects page](/projects/) to see what I've been working on!
