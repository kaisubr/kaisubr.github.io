I'm an undergraduate CS student with a strong interest in software engineering, computer vision, and applications of data science. 

I have applied these interests in some projects which have won awards, such as an augmented reality platform and an app that used image classification via a CNN. [Jump to my projects page](/projects/) to see what I've been working on!
